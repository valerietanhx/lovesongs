# lovesongs

A website for people to share their memories associated with songs.

My first attempt at full-stack web development. Inspired by Chia Amisola's [The Sound of Love](https://thesoundof.love/) and Rora Blue's [Unsent Project](https://theunsentproject.com/), as well as the songs that I can't listen to without remembering a specific moment in time.

_While this repository was created in May 2024, most of the code here was first written in August 2023, when I was still very new to web development._
